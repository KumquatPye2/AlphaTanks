# Optimal Hosting Strategy for Your Needs

## Current Situation Analysis:
- ✅ DiscountASP.NET: Working well, good pricing, familiar
- ✅ AlphaTanks: Static app that needs deployment
- ⚠️ SSL: $10/month would be expensive for static content

## Recommended Multi-Platform Strategy:

### Platform 1: DiscountASP.NET (Keep)
**Best for:**
- Dynamic ASP.NET applications
- Server-side processing
- Database-driven apps
- Your existing Complexity apps

**Use for:**
- Current site at `http://evostevo.com`
- Future ASP.NET projects
- Traditional web hosting needs

### Platform 2: GitHub Pages (Add)
**Best for:**
- Static websites and apps
- Portfolio projects
- Demo applications
- JavaScript-heavy apps

**Use for:**
- AlphaTanks at `https://kumquatpye2.github.io/AlphaTanks/`
- Future static projects
- Free HTTPS deployment

## Cost Comparison:

### Option A: DiscountASP.NET Only (with SSL)
- Hosting: ~$8-15/month
- SSL Add-on: $10/month
- **Total: $18-25/month ($216-300/year)**

### Option B: DiscountASP.NET + GitHub Pages (Recommended)
- DiscountASP.NET: ~$8-15/month (keep current plan)
- GitHub Pages: Free
- **Total: $8-15/month ($96-180/year)**
- **Savings: $120+/year**

### Option C: Alternative Hosting (If you wanted to switch)
**Netlify:** Free tier + $19/month for pro features
**Vercel:** Free tier + $20/month for teams
**Cloudflare Pages:** Free + $5/month for pro
**Digital Ocean:** $5-12/month + setup complexity

## Why Multi-Platform is Better Than Switching:

### Advantages:
1. **Best tool for each job** - ASP.NET hosting + static hosting
2. **Cost optimization** - Pay for what you need
3. **Risk mitigation** - Not dependent on single provider
4. **Performance** - CDN for static, traditional hosting for dynamic
5. **Learning** - Experience with modern deployment workflows

### Disadvantages:
1. **Slight complexity** - Managing two platforms
2. **DNS management** - If you want custom domains for both

## Implementation Plan:

### Phase 1: Quick Win (Today)
1. **Deploy AlphaTanks to GitHub Pages** (5 minutes)
2. **Get instant HTTPS access** at professional URL
3. **Keep DiscountASP.NET as-is**

### Phase 2: Optimization (This Week)
1. **Test both platforms** thoroughly
2. **Decide on custom domain strategy** (if needed)
3. **Document your deployment workflow**

### Phase 3: Long-term (Future)
1. **Use GitHub Pages** for all static projects
2. **Use DiscountASP.NET** for dynamic/database projects
3. **Evaluate** based on actual usage patterns

## Bottom Line:
DiscountASP.NET is good hosting - there's no need to abandon it. Just complement it with free static hosting for projects like AlphaTanks. You'll save money and get better performance for static content.

## Alternative Single-Platform Options (If you really want to consolidate):

### If Staying with Traditional Hosting:
- **Namecheap:** Similar pricing, includes SSL
- **Hostinger:** Very cheap, good performance
- **SiteGround:** More expensive but excellent support

### If Going Full Modern:
- **Netlify:** Best for static + serverless
- **Vercel:** Excellent for React/Next.js
- **Cloudflare Pages:** Great performance, generous free tier

But honestly, **keeping DiscountASP.NET + adding GitHub Pages** gives you the best of both worlds at the lowest cost.
