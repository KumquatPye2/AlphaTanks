# Contributing to AlphaTanks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AlphaTanks as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints (ESLint).
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlphaTanks.git
cd AlphaTanks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
npm test

# Start development
npm start
```

## Code Quality Standards

- **ESLint**: All code must pass ESLint with zero errors
- **Tests**: New features require corresponding tests
- **Documentation**: Update README.md for significant changes
- **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Run full test suite
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```
