  AlphaTanks is an implementation of the ASI-ARCH (Artificial Superintelligence 
  for AI Research) methodology demonstrating autonomous AI evolution through 
  competitive tank battle simulation. The system showcases how AI can conduct 
  independent research, discovering novel combat tactics through computational 
  research scaling principles.
