## 🎯 Overview

**AlphaTanks** is a revolutionary tank battle simulation that implements the **ASI-ARCH** (Artificial Superintelligence for AI Research) methodology. Unlike traditional games, AlphaTanks features autonomous AI that evolves its own strategies without human intervention, demonstrating real-time computational research scaling.

The system showcases how AI can conduct independent research, discovering novel combat tactics and continuously improving through competitive coevolution - the "Red Queen Race" effect where opposing teams drive each other to greater sophistication.

> **📚 Research Foundation**: This implementation is based on the ASI-ARCH methodology as described in the research paper:
> 
> *"Artificial Superintelligence for AI Research (ASI-ARCH): A Framework for Computational Research Scaling"* (arXiv:2507.18074v1)
> 
> The paper presents a novel approach where AI systems conduct autonomous research, and AlphaTanks demonstrates these principles through evolutionary tank AI that discovers emergent military tactics without human guidance.

Watch as simple random behaviors evolve into sophisticated military tactics!

## 🧬 Evolution System

### Genome Structure
Each tank is controlled by a **9-trait genome** that determines its behavior:

| Trait | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Aggression** | 0.0-1.0 | Likelihood to engage enemies vs. defensive positioning |
| **Speed** | 0.0-1.0 | Movement velocity and reaction time |
| **Accuracy** | 0.0-1.0 | Weapon targeting precision |
| **Defense** | 0.0-1.0 | Shield usage and defensive maneuvering |
| **Teamwork** | 0.0-1.0 | Coordination with team members |
| **Adaptability** | 0.0-1.0 | Response to changing battle conditions |
| **Learning** | 0.0-1.0 | Ability to modify behavior during battle |
| **Risk-taking** | 0.0-1.0 | Willingness to take tactical risks |
| **Evasion** | 0.0-1.0 | Avoidance and escape behaviors |

### Evolutionary Process
1. **Population Initialization**: 20 tanks per team with random genomes
2. **Battle Testing**: Real combat evaluation (no simulation)
3. **Fitness Calculation**: Multi-component scoring system
4. **Selection**: Elite preservation + tournament selection
5. **Reproduction**: Crossover and mutation of successful traits
6. **Red Queen Escalation**: Dynamic fitness thresholds increase pressure

### Fitness Components
```javascript
fitness = (survivalTime * 0.3) + 
          (damageDealt * 0.4) + 
          (kills * 0.2) + 
          (teamSupport * 0.1) +
          redQueenWeighting
```

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### ASI-ARCH Research Scaling
The system demonstrates **computational research scaling** through:

- **Automated Hypothesis Generation**: AI proposes new behavioral architectures
- **Empirical Testing**: Real-time battle validation of hypotheses  
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identification of emergent tactical principles
