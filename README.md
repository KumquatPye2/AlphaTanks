## 🧬 Evolution System

### Genome Structure
Each tank is controlled by a **9-trait genome** that determines its behavior:

| Trait | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Aggression** | 0.0-1.0 | Likelihood to engage enemies vs. defensive positioning |
| **Speed** | 0.0-1.0 | Movement velocity and reaction time |
| **Accuracy** | 0.0-1.0 | Weapon targeting precision |
| **Defense** | 0.0-1.0 | Shield usage and defensive maneuvering |
| **Teamwork** | 0.0-1.0 | Coordination with team members |
| **Adaptability** | 0.0-1.0 | Response to changing battle conditions |
| **Learning** | 0.0-1.0 | Ability to modify behavior during battle |
| **Risk-taking** | 0.0-1.0 | Willingness to take tactical risks |
| **Evasion** | 0.0-1.0 | Avoidance and escape behaviors |

### Evolutionary Process
1. **Population Initialization**: 20 tanks per team with random genomes
2. **Battle Testing**: Real combat evaluation (no simulation)
3. **Fitness Calculation**: Multi-component scoring system
4. **Selection**: Elite preservation + tournament selection
5. **Reproduction**: Crossover and mutation of successful traits
6. **Red Queen Escalation**: Dynamic fitness thresholds increase pressure

### Fitness Components
```javascript
fitness = (survivalTime * 0.3) + 
          (damageDealt * 0.4) + 
          (kills * 0.2) + 
          (teamSupport * 0.1) +
          redQueenWeighting
```

## 🔬 Research Methodology
